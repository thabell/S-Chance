# S-Chance
board game detective

There is a packed executable file here: https://github.com/thabell/S-Chance/tree/master/dist
For the "main.exe" to work, the file "game_base.db" is required next to "main.exe",
which also lies in the "dist".
It is also recommended to install fonts from "dist".
Enjoy your quest!
